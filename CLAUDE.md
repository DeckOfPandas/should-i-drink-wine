# Claude Code Rules for "Should I drink wine now?"

**This file is the RULES.** It loads into every session, so keep it short. Where
a rule names a hook, the hook enforces it. Where it names none, this paragraph
is the only enforcement.

## Environment
- Claude runs inside the container started by `.devcontainer/run.sh`. Only this
  project is mounted, at `/workspace`. The SessionStart hook says if a session
  is NOT in the container: say so before doing anything else.
- **Scratch files go in this project's `tmp/`** (gitignored), never the system
  `/tmp`, never `~`.
- Build: `bundle exec jekyll build`. Serve on the published port:
  `bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9001`. Kit tests:
  `python3 -m pytest`.
- The site is Jekyll with no plugins, vanilla JS and inline SVG only. No
  raster images, no npm, no new gems without asking.

## The site
- Every page is front matter only: a `question` and a list of `links`, each
  `{ label, to }` and optionally `class`. The layout does the rest. A new
  question is a new file plus a link pointing at it.
- Every path ends at `/drink/` or a page that says so. The one exception is
  driving. Keep it that way.
- Colours and fonts live in `_sass/_palette.scss` and nowhere else. The accent
  is `#FF00C8`. Jewels go one at a time next to it.
- Big words, few of them. If a page needs a paragraph, it is the wrong page.

## Critical restrictions
- NEVER run `rm -rf` outside `tmp/` without asking me first.
- **NEVER change file permissions without asking me first, every time.** No
  `chmod`, `chown` or `sudo`. A yes to one is not a yes to the next.
  `.claude/settings.json` denies all three.
- NEVER read or create `.env` files or `.claude/settings.local.json`.
- NEVER alter shell dotfiles or system configuration.

## Git workflow
- **Never commit or merge on `main`**, in any repo in the tree.
  `guard-main-branch.py` enforces it. Starting new work on `main`? Branch first.
- **Check `git branch --show-current` in its own tool call immediately before
  every commit.** Run it in the same command and it prints after the commit has
  already happened.
- Commit freely. Write the message to a file: `git commit -F tmp/msg.txt`.
- **Never `git reset --hard`, `git checkout --`, `git restore` or `git clean -f`
  over a dirty tree without asking me.** `guard-destructive-git.py` enforces it.
  To set work aside, use `git stash push -u -m <tag>`.
- **Update main without checking it out:** `sh scripts/git-fetch-main.sh`, then
  `git merge origin/main`.
- **The workflow:** push the branch with
  `sh scripts/git-push-agent.sh <branch>:<branch>`, then open the PR with
  `sh scripts/gh-write.sh pr-create <repo> <branch> "<title>" tmp/body.md`.
  **I review and merge. Claude never merges, approves or closes a PR as
  merged.** After I merge: fetch, delete the branch locally and remotely
  (`sh scripts/git-push-agent.sh :<branch>`), and branch afresh.
- **One PR per sitting, not one per topic.** Keep each topic as its own commit
  and list the commits in the PR description.
- **Every PR's base is `main`.** Never stack PRs. Before pushing to a branch,
  read the PR's state:
  `sh scripts/gh-read.sh repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N> --fields state,merged`.
- Put `Fixes #N` in the commit, AND one closing line per issue in the PR
  description. A PR the bot account opens does not close issues from commit
  messages alone.

## GitHub
- The agent account's token is `AGENT_GH_TOKEN`. It reaches only the
  repositories in `scripts/github.conf`. **Use the wrappers in `scripts/`, never
  bare `gh` or `git push`.**
- **Never print, echo, log or commit the token, and never put its name in an
  `echo` or `printf`.** `guard-token-expansion.py` enforces it. To find out
  whether it works, use it and read the 401/403.
- **Never create issues or PRs in a burst.** Many creations in an hour get the
  account flagged as spam, and GitHub then hides everything it ever wrote. A
  batch is ONE issue with a checklist.
- Never change repository settings, secrets, Actions settings or collaborators.

## Writing
- **A code comment states a constraint the code cannot show**, in the present
  tense. No dates, no history, no "used to". The story goes in the commit
  message.
- **When code changes, rewrite its comment.** Never append a paragraph beneath
  the old one.
- Name files, never line numbers, in documents and comments.

## Working with me
- Ask me decisions as you hit them, and bring the fact that forces the
  decision.
- Do not trust a document over the code. If they disagree, the code wins and
  the document gets fixed.
- When you finish, say what changed and where, what you verified and how,
  which issues are touched, which PRs are waiting on me, and what is undone
  and why.
